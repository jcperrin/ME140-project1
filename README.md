This is a set of code that our project team generated to analyse the
performance of a jet engine.

## TODO

* Refactor code to be a function that accepts the variables provided by the
project handout and then runs for either the constant cp case or the
variable cp case.
* Seperate out the stagnation temperature code into a seperate function.
